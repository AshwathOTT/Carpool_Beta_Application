# Carpool_Beta_Application
Overview
Welcome to the Carpool Application, a beta version designed to facilitate ride-sharing among users. This application currently includes a basic simulation with pre-built users and a custom UI that integrates Google Maps.

Features
1. User Authentication: Log in with predefined user credentials.
2. Google Maps Integration: Open Google Maps within the application to view locations.
3. Ride Token Management: Simulated token management system to track ride usage.
4. Users
5. The application currently supports the following pre-built users and manual input of the respectieve adderesses for simulation purposes:

USERNAME / PASSWORD
user1 / pass1
user2 / pass2
ashwath.s / ashwath@108
enguyen4 / 3th4n2007

Future Plans
User Radius Detection
5 Mile Radius: We plan to add functionality that detects users within a 5-mile radius of their current location.
Backend Integration
Firebase Hosting: Once we get a server hosted by Firebase, we'll add user registration and login functionality, making the linkage between HTML and Java more seamless.
Mobile Expansion
iOS Development: We plan to expand to Xcode in the future to run this application on iPhones.


Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA.
Run the Application:

Navigate to WelcomeScreen.java and run the main method.
Log in with one of the predefined user credentials.

Google Maps Integration:
Ensure the path to GoogleMaps.html in the HomeScreen class is correct for your system.
The map will open in your default web browser when you click "Open Google Maps."
note - the first text input can only accept cities but the other 2 can accept any address

Note
This is a beta application and is currently under development. The current implementation is a simulation and lacks real-time user detection and dynamic backend services.
